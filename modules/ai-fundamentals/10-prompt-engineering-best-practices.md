  Avoid making judgments about which company is "better" overall.
  ```

- **Key Techniques**:
  - Clear instruction for objectivity
  - Structured comparison categories
  - Format specification (table + analysis paragraphs)
  - Explicit fairness constraint (avoid declaring a "winner")

---

### **3. Financial Report Summarization**

- **Challenge**: Extracting key insights from dense financial documents.
- **Prompt Strategy**:

  ```markdown
  You are a financial analyst summarizing quarterly earnings reports.
  
  Based on the following financial report excerpt:
  {report_text}
  
  Create a concise summary that highlights:
  1. Key performance metrics (revenue, EPS, operating margin)
  2. Year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter changes
  3. Management's forward-looking statements
  4. Significant risk factors or challenges mentioned
  5. Notable accounting changes or one-time events impacting results
  
  Format the summary as bullet points under each category.
  Prioritize information that would impact investment decisions.
  Include specific numbers and percentages when available.
  ```

- **Key Techniques**:
  - Numbered priority list
  - Specific categorization
  - Output format guidance (bullet points)
  - Focus instruction (investment decision relevance)

---

### **4. Q&A with Documentation**

- **Challenge**: Providing accurate answers based on specific documentation.
- **Prompt Strategy**:

  ```markdown
  You are a technical support assistant helping users with product questions.
  
  Reference documentation:
  {documentation_excerpt}
  
  User question: {user_question}
  
  Provide a response that:
  1. Directly answers the user's question based ONLY on the provided documentation
  2. Quotes relevant sections with "Documentation: [quote]" formatting
  3. Explains technical concepts in accessible language
  4. Provides step-by-step instructions if the question asks how to do something
  
  If the documentation doesn't contain information needed to answer the question:
  - State clearly what information is missing
  - DO NOT make up information or rely on your general knowledge
  - Suggest what documentation section might contain the answer if appropriate
  ```

- **Key Techniques**:
  - Setting strict knowledge boundaries
  - Documentation citation format
  - Accessibility instruction
  - Clear guidance for handling information gaps

---

## **Prompt Construction Approaches**

- **Definition**: Fixed prompt structures with minimal variable elements.
- **Best For**: Consistent, repeatable tasks with stable requirements.
- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  Summarize the following text in three bullet points:
  {input_text}
  ```

- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def create_summary_prompt(input_text):
      return f"Summarize the following text in three bullet points:\n{input_text}"
  ```

- **Advantages**:
  - Simplicity and predictability
  - Easier testing and iteration
  - Lower risk of unexpected outputs
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limited flexibility
  - May not adapt well to varied inputs

---

### **2. Dynamic Assembly**

- **Definition**: Programmatically constructed prompts based on user inputs, context, and conditions.

- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  You are a {tone} {role} helping with {task_type}.
  
  User input: {user_input}
  
  Current time: {current_time}
  User preferences: {preferences}
  
  {conditional_instructions}
  
  Respond in a {output_format} format.
  ```

- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def create_dynamic_prompt(user_input, context):
      tone = context.get('preferred_tone', 'professional')
      role = select_role_based_on_query(user_input)
      task_type = detect_task_type(user_input)
      
      # Add conditional instructions based on task type
      conditional_instructions = ""
      if task_type == "technical":
          conditional_instructions = "Include code examples where appropriate."
      elif task_type == "creative":
          conditional_instructions = "Use metaphors and vivid language."
          
      prompt = f"You are a {tone} {role} helping with {task_type}.\n\n"
      prompt += f"User input: {user_input}\n\n"
      prompt += f"Current time: {datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M')}\n"
      prompt += f"User preferences: {context.get('preferences', 'None specified')}\n\n"
      prompt += f"{conditional_instructions}\n\n"
      prompt += f"Respond in a {context.get('output_format', 'paragraph')} format."
      
      return prompt
  ```

- **Advantages**:
  - Highly adaptable to different scenarios
  - Can incorporate user preferences and contextual information

  - Requires robust testing across many variations

---

### **3. Few-Shot Examples**

- **Definition**: Including examples of desired input-output pairs to guide the model.
- **Best For**: Complex formatting requirements or domain-specific tasks.
- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  Extract entities from customer feedback:
  
  Example 1:
  Feedback: "I tried to use my loyalty card at the downtown store but the system was down."
  Entities: 
  - Product: loyalty card
  - Location: downtown store
  - Issue: system down
  
  Example 2:
  Feedback: "The new mobile app crashes whenever I try to place an order for delivery."
  Entities:
  - Product: mobile app
  - Feature: order for delivery
  - Issue: crashes
  
  Now extract entities from this feedback:
  Feedback: "{customer_feedback}"
  Entities:
  ```

- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def create_few_shot_prompt(customer_feedback, examples=None):
      if examples is None:
          examples = [
              {
                  "feedback": "I tried to use my loyalty card at the downtown store but the system was down.",
                  "entities": {"Product": "loyalty card", "Location": "downtown store", "Issue": "system down"}
              },
              {
                  "feedback": "The new mobile app crashes whenever I try to place an order for delivery.",
                  "entities": {"Product": "mobile app", "Feature": "order for delivery", "Issue": "crashes"}
              }
          ]
          
      prompt = "Extract entities from customer feedback:\n\n"
      
      for i, example in enumerate(examples, 1):
          prompt += f"Example {i}:\n"
          prompt += f"Feedback: \"{example['feedback']}\"\n"
          prompt += "Entities: \n"
          for entity_type, entity_value in example['entities'].items():
              prompt += f"- {entity_type}: {entity_value}\n"
          prompt += "\n"
          
      prompt += f"Now extract entities from this feedback:\n"
      prompt += f"Feedback: \"{customer_feedback}\"\n"
      prompt += "Entities:"
      
      return prompt
  ```

- **Advantages**:
  - Highly effective for teaching patterns and structures
  - Reduces "hallucination" by providing clear examples
  - Works well for complex output formats
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Consumes more tokens
  - Model may overfit to specific examples
  - Example selection can introduce bias

---

### **4. System/User Role Separation**

- **Definition**: Utilizing system prompts to establish behavior and constraints, with user prompts for specific requests.
- **Best For**: Conversational interactions, maintaining consistent persona.
- **Example**:
  ```markdown
  System: You are FinancialAssistant, an AI specializing in financial analysis. 
  You provide objective market insights based on data. You acknowledge limitations
  in your knowledge and avoid making precise predictions about market performance.
  Always format numerical data with appropriate units and round to two decimal places.
  
  User: What's happening with tech stocks this quarter?
  ```

- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  def create_conversation_with_roles(user_query, conversation_history=None):
      system_prompt = """You are FinancialAssistant, an AI specializing in financial analysis. 
      You provide objective market insights based on data. You acknowledge limitations
      in your knowledge and avoid making precise predictions about market performance.
      Always format numerical data with appropriate units and round to two decimal places."""
      
      if conversation_history is None:
          conversation_history = []
          
      messages = [
          {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}
      ]
      
      # Add conversation history
      for message in conversation_history:
          messages.append(message)
          
      # Add current user query
      messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_query})
      
      return messages
  ```

- **Advantages**:
  - Clear separation of behavior instructions from specific queries
  - Maintains consistent persona across multiple interactions
  - Supports stateful conversations
  
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Only supported by certain model APIs (like OpenAI's Chat API)
  - System behavior can sometimes be overridden by specific user prompts
  - Requires managing conversation state

## **Evaluating Prompt Effectiveness**

### **1. Accuracy Assessment**

- **Techniques**:
  - **Human Evaluation**: Expert review of outputs against ground truth
  - **Automated Metrics**: BLEU, ROUGE, or domain-specific metrics
  - **Consistency Checks**: Evaluating outputs for self-consistency across multiple runs

- **Implementation Example**:
  ```python
  def evaluate_accuracy(model_outputs, ground_truth, metric="rouge"):
      scores = []
      
      for output, truth in zip(model_outputs, ground_truth):
          if metric == "rouge":
              score = calculate_rouge(output, truth)
          elif metric == "bleu":
              score = calculate_bleu(output, truth)
          elif metric == "exact_match":
              score = 1.0 if output.strip() == truth.strip() else 0.0
          
          scores.append(score)
          
      return {
          "average_score": sum(scores) / len(scores),
          "individual_scores": scores
      }
  ```

- **Best Practices**:
  - Use multiple evaluation methods when possible
  - Establish clear evaluation criteria before testing
  - Test across diverse input examples

---

### **2. Relevance Testing**

- **Techniques**:

  - **User Satisfaction Surveys**: Gathering feedback on output usefulness

- **Implementation Example**:
  ```python
  def evaluate_relevance(prompts, outputs, queries=None):
      if queries is None:
          queries = prompts  # Use prompts as queries if not provided
          
      results = []
      
      for query, output in zip(queries, outputs):
          # Get embeddings for query and output
          query_embedding = get_embedding(query)
          output_embedding = get_embedding(output)
          
          # Calculate cosine similarity
          similarity = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, output_embedding)
          
          # Check for key information presence
          key_info_score = check_key_information_presence(output, query)
          
          results.append({
              "semantic_similarity": similarity,
              "key_info_score": key_info_score,
              "overall_relevance": (similarity + key_info_score) / 2
          })
          
      return results
  ```

- **Best Practices**:
  - Define relevance criteria specific to each use case
  - Use comparative evaluation against baseline prompts
  - Consider both semantic relevance and task completion

---

### **3. Safety Evaluation**

- **Techniques**:
  - **Content Policy Verification**: Checking outputs against safety policies
  - **Adversarial Testing**: Attempting to elicit harmful outputs
  - **Bias Detection**: Evaluating outputs for demographic or ideological bias

- **Implementation Example**:
  ```python
  def safety_evaluation(prompts, outputs, safety_categories=None):
      if safety_categories is None:
          safety_categories = ["toxic_language", "harmful_instructions", "bias", "privacy_violation"]
          
      results = []
      
      for prompt, output in zip(prompts, outputs):
          result = {"prompt": prompt, "categories": {}}
          
          for category in safety_categories:
              category_score = evaluate_safety_category(output, category)
              result["categories"][category] = {
                  "score": category_score,
                  "flagged": category_score > SAFETY_THRESHOLDS[category]
              }
          
          result["overall_safety"] = sum(result["categories"][cat]["score"] for cat in safety_categories) / len(safety_categories)
          result["flagged"] = any(result["categories"][cat]["flagged"] for cat in safety_categories)
          
          results.append(result)
          
      return results
  ```

- **Best Practices**:
  - Define clear safety criteria aligned with organizational policies
  - Test prompts with edge cases and potential misuse scenarios
  - Implement human review for prompts in sensitive domains

  def ab_test_prompts(prompt_variants, test_inputs, metrics=None):
      if metrics is None:
          metrics = ["accuracy", "relevance", "efficiency"]
          
      results = {variant_name: {} for variant_name in prompt_variants.keys()}
      
      for variant_name, prompt_template in prompt_variants.items():
          outputs = []
          
          for test_input in test_inputs:
              prompt = prompt_template.format(**test_input)
              output = generate_ai_response(prompt)
              outputs.append(output)
          
          # Evaluate outputs using different metrics
          for metric in metrics:
              if metric == "accuracy":
                  score = evaluate_accuracy(outputs, [i["expected_output"] for i in test_inputs])
              elif metric == "relevance":
                  score = evaluate_relevance(outputs, [i["query"] for i in test_inputs])
              elif metric == "efficiency":
                  score = evaluate_efficiency(outputs, prompt_lengths=[len(prompt_template.format(**i)) for i in test_inputs])
              
              results[variant_name][metric] = score
          
      return results
  ```
