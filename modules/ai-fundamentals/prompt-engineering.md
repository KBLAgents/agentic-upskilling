## **Prompt Basics**

### **1. What is Prompt Engineering?**
- **Definition**: The art and science of crafting inputs (prompts) to guide AI behavior and generate tailored outputs.  
- **Importance**:  
  - Unlocks the true potential of large language models (LLMs).  
  - Enhances model accuracy and relevance.  
- **Applications**: Coding, content creation, academic research, customer service, etc.  

---

### **2. Components of a Prompt**
- **Structure**:  
  - **Context or Instruction**: Setting the stage for the AI's response.  
    Example: *"You are an expert chef specializing in Italian cuisine."*  

  - **Task**: Specific action required from the AI.  
    Example: *"List the ingredients for classic spaghetti carbonara in bullet points."*  

  - **Examples (Few-shot Learning)**: Providing examples to guide output precision.  
    Example:  
    *Input*:  
    - Text: "Bonjour" → Translation: "Hello"  
    - Text: "Merci" → Translation: "Thank you"  
    *Task*: Translate "Au revoir" →  

- **Key Features**:  
  - **Clarity**: Reduce ambiguity.  
    Example (Bad): *"Tell me about a thing."*  
    Example (Good): *"Explain the pros and cons of electric vehicles in a concise format."*

### **3. Types of Prompts**
- **Zero-shot Prompts**: Provide simple instructions without examples.  
  - Example:  
    *"Summarize the following text in one paragraph."*  
    Input:  
    "Artificial intelligence is transforming industries by enabling automation for repetitive tasks."  
    Output:  
    "AI is revolutionizing industries through automation and efficiency."  

- **Few-shot Prompts**: Include examples for better guidance.  
  - Example:  
    *"Generate a title for a blog post based on the following examples:*  
    **Examples**:  
      - Blog about AI ethics → Title: 'Navigating the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence'  
      - Blog about renewable energy → Title: 'Harnessing Energy for a Sustainable Future'  
    *Your task: Blog about robotics → Title:*  

- **Chain of Thought Prompts**: Encourage step-by-step reasoning.  
  - Example:  
    *"You are a math tutor. Solve the problem and explain each step: 25 × (10 + 3)."*  
    Output:  
    *"Step 1: Calculate the parentheses. 10 + 3 = 13.  
    Step 2: Multiply 25 by 13. 25 × 13 = 325.*"  

- **Instruction-tuned Prompts**: Optimized for models trained on instruction datasets.  
  - Example:  
    *"Write a motivational quote that inspires students to learn."*

## **Advanced Strategies**

### **1. Prompt Optimization**
- **Key Techniques**:  
  - **Iterative Refinement**: Adjust and test prompts repeatedly.  
    Example:  
    *Initial Prompt*: *"Write some tips for saving money."*  
    *Refined Prompt*: *"Write 5 actionable tips for saving money, best suited for young professionals, in no more than 100 words."*  

  - **Error Analysis**: Evaluate outputs to identify prompt-based flaws.  
    Example: If the AI outputs overly verbose text, modify the prompt to include the constraint: *"Be concise and use bullet points."*  
  - **Variability Testing**: Experiment with different phrasings such as "List" vs. "Enumerate."  

---

### **2. Dynamic Prompts**
- **Concept**: Automating prompt generation based on dynamic inputs.  
- **Use Cases**:  
  - Personalized chat: *"Hello {user_name}, how can I assist you with {topic} today?"*  
  - Automated form generation: *"Create a checklist based on the following categories: {category_1}, {category_2}."*  

---

### **3. Prompt Chaining**
- **Definition**: Linking multiple prompts to create complex workflows.  
  - Example:  
    1. Prompt 1: *"Summarize this article in bullet points."*  
    2. Prompt 2: *"Based on the summary, write an abstract for a research paper."*  
    3. Prompt 3: *"Translate the abstract into Spanish."*  

---

### **4. Incorporating Context**
- **Definition**: Adding external or historical data to enhance understanding.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - **Embedding-Based Retrieval**: Query a database to provide context to the model.  
  - **Memory-Based Systems**: AI recalls prior interactions for continuity.  
  - Example:  
    AI Interaction  
    - User: *"What is the capital of France?"* → AI: *"The capital of France is Paris."*  
    - User: *"Tell me more about it."* → AI: *"Paris is known for its iconic Eiffel Tower, art museums, and historical landmarks."*

## **Tools for Prompt Engineering**

### **1. OpenAI Playground**
- **Purpose**: Test and refine prompts interactively.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - GPT models fine-tuned for instructions.  
  - Token visualization and cost estimation.  
- **Example**: Use Playground to check the token count for a long prompt and experiment with refinement.

### **3. Prompt Libraries**
- **Examples**:  
  - **PromptBase**: Repository of high-quality curated prompts.  
  - **GitHub**: Community-contributed prompts and templates.

## **Challenges in Prompt Engineering**

### **1. Ambiguity**
- **Problem**: Vague instructions leading to incorrect outputs.  
- **Solution**: Use concrete terms and examples.  
  Example:  
  - Bad: "Tell me about AI."  
  - Good: "Explain the applications of AI in healthcare in bullet points."  

---

### **2. Token and Cost Management**
- **Problem**: Large prompts consuming excessive tokens and increasing API costs.  
- **Solution**: Optimize prompt length and utilize embedding-based approaches.  
  Example: Reduce verbosity:  
  - Instead of: "Write a detailed historical analysis…"  
  - Use: "Summarize the history of Rome in 300 words."  

---

### **3. Bias Control**
- **Problem**: Prompts inadvertently reflect cultural and content biases.  
- **Solution**: Test with diverse examples and iterate for fairness.
