#  Prompt Flow Pipelines

## üß† What are Prompt Flow Pipelines?

Prompt Flow Pipelines are structured workflows that orchestrate the sequence of operations involving prompts, models, tools, and data sources to build robust and scalable LLM applications. They enable developers to design, test, evaluate, and deploy complex AI solutions by chaining together various components in a modular fashion.

**Key Benefits:**

* **Modularity:** Encourages reusable and maintainable components.
* **Scalability:** Facilitates scaling applications by managing complex workflows.
* **Observability:** Provides insights into each step of the pipeline for debugging and optimization.
* **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with various tools, APIs, and data sources.

**Components:**

1. **Prompt Nodes:** Define the prompts sent to the LLMs.
2. **Tool Nodes:** Integrate external tools or APIs for data retrieval or processing.
3. **Control Flow Nodes:** Manage the execution flow, including branching and looping.
4. **Data Stores:** Hold intermediate and final data used across the pipeline.
5. **Evaluation Nodes:** Assess the outputs for quality and performance metrics.([Medium][1], [Google Cloud][2])
