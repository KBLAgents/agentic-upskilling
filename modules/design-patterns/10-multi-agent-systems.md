## Multi-Agent Systems

### üß† What Are Multi-Agent Systems?

Multi-agent systems consist of multiple autonomous entities, known as agents, that interact within an environment to achieve individual or collective goals. Each agent operates independently, perceiving its environment, making decisions, and performing actions. The collective behavior of these agents can lead to complex, emergent phenomena, enabling solutions to problems that are difficult for single-agent systems to handle.

**Key Characteristics:**

* **Autonomy:** Agents operate without direct intervention, controlling their actions and internal states.
* **Social Ability:** Agents interact with other agents (and possibly humans) via communication languages.
* **Reactivity:** Agents perceive their environment and respond to changes promptly.
* **Proactiveness:** Agents exhibit goal-directed behavior by taking the initiative.

A typical multi-agent system architecture includes:

1. **Agents:** Autonomous units with specific roles and capabilities.
2. **Environment:** The context within which agents operate and interact.
3. **Communication Mechanism:** Protocols and languages facilitating agent interactions.
4. **Coordination Framework:** Structures enabling agents to work together harmoniously.

### üîç Use Cases

* **Healthcare:** Coordinating patient care through agents representing doctors, nurses, and administrative staff.
* **Smart Grids:** Managing energy distribution by agents controlling different grid components.
* **E-commerce:** Personalized shopping experiences through buyer and seller agents negotiating deals.
* **Robotics:** Swarm robotics where multiple robots coordinate for tasks like search and rescue.
